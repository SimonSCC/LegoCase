Case for Associate Engineer


Description
We use different materials to produce different LEGO bricks. You are in a development team which works with the material data and vendor data.  Now you have a JSON file which contains material object and vendor object, see the JSON attachment. We would like you to develop a solution for some the following tasks: 


•	Sort out all the vendors and the materials that the vendor offers. 

•	For each material, find the cheapest vendor and its deliver time. 
Note: different vendors offer their material in different currency and weight unit, so you need to take the currency, and weight conversion into consideration. 

•	Find the best offer for the material Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) and the melting point between 200C to 300C.  Note: you should also consider the deliver time and cost, and eco-friendly, etc. 

•	[Open question] - Any issues with the data model, and how can we improve it? 

•	[Open question] - Any other filter options you might think that might be useful?  


Requirements
•	You can use the language that you are most comfortable with, preferably an object-oriented language such as C#, TypeScript, Java etc. 
•	We do not expect a fully functional application, we want to see what and how you have accomplished the task rather than giving us the correct answers. 
•	You have the free choice about displaying the result, through a printout of a function, or go the extra mile to create a display. 
•	You should not spend more than 3hr on this. 
•	Upload your solution to a git repository and send us the link. 


What we are evaluating
•	Problem solving, how you deal with ambiguities. 
•	Basic programming skills, code structure, readability
•	Basic logic and data-structure knowledge
•	Communication skills
